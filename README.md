# iOS_Message_Backup
Backs up iOS messages from an iTunes iOS Backup and puts them into html files to be easily readable, and searchable.

This is a little project I made over a couple of days to solve a problem I had. I had too many messages on my iPhone and I wanted to delete them off the phone, yet maintain a record of the messages in case I ever wanted to look at them in the future. This project takes an unencrypted iTunes iOS Backup and pulls the messages out of the sms.db file and organizes them in .html files in a similar looking way to the iOS Messages application for simplicity. Essentially, it takes the iTunes backup you made and copies the messages (and attachments) stored within the backup in an easily readable HTML format elsewhere on your computer.

This was a small side project which I do not plan to maintain or otherwise support. MIT Licensing so if you want to fork and improve you are welcome to do so, but I do not plan on maintaining this myself since it is just a one time solution to a problem I had.
